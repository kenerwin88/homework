It owns a wide array of strong brands, including Cosco, Schwinn, Ironhorse, and Mongoose.  While Dorel is a strong player in the bicycle industry, it recently announced (In January of this year) that it would be shuttering its bicycle assembly facilities in the United States and moving to Asia in order to become more competitive.  Annual sales are roughly \$2.6 billion, and with a restructuring of the Recreational/Leisure unit, Dorel expects to save at least \$6 million annually.  Dorel’s primary competitors include Kid Brands, Inc., Trek Bicycle Corporation, and Evenflo Company, Inc.Employs 6,300 people in facilities located in twenty-four countries worldwide.
