This report consists of five major sections.  Initially a brief history of Dorel Industries will be provided, followed secondly by an analysis of its competitive and corporate strategies.  Third, is a breakdown financial analysis of Dorel’s financials, both as a whole and by individual units.  Using this data, the report will then delve into the company’s current issues and possible solutions while incorporating various tools (BCG, Five Tests analysis, etc.).  The final segment of the report will include our recommendations for the company, concluding with suggested initiatives to improve Dorel’s competitive and corporate strategies.
